## skills:
Growth-mindset:
* I have been done for a while, So I have been forced to stick with my project and think of what's wrong with it.

Debugging
* There have been a lot of bugs with the sounds playing and event listeners, so I have to mess wround with the code, ultimately discovering each new sound needs a different keyword.


## future plans:
* I have already done some of them, like adding DOM features like colors changing on click.
* I will wait until we get to show our project to others in class to get feedback on anything I can potentially add or change.
