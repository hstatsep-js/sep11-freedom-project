# Entry 6
##### 5/22/24

I have completed my freedomproject!!! (MVP, Beyond MVP, and presented my work)


## important takeaways from in-class presentation
Things I think I did well
* I spoke loud enough
* my slides looked good
* my project was presentable

Things I can improve on . . .
* I need to get better at remembering the content of my slides, I think I read too much off my slides
* Speak more clearly and slowly, I kept jumbling up my words because of the stress I felt, and I felt like an amateur
* Be less stressed. Everyone else that presented was likely stressed to be up there too, it's a natural feeling but being too anxious will ruin any momentum you have.
