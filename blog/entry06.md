# Entry 6
##### 5/22/24

I have completed my freedomproject!!! (MVP, Beyond MVP, and presented my work)


## important takeaways from in-class presentation
Things I think I did well
* I spoke loud enough
* my slides looked good
* my project was presentable

Things I can improve on . . .
* I need to get better at remembering the content of my slides, I feel like I read too much off my slides
* Speak more clearly and slowly, I kept jumbling up my words because of the stress I felt, and I felt like an amateur
* Be less stressed. Everyone else that presented was likely stressed to be up there too, it's a natural feeling but being too anxious will ruin any momentum you have.
* Explainb my thoughts more, people don't know what went into the creation of my product, so i shouldn't just skip over it to get to the project.

my notes for the elevator pitch

```
Hook:
Do you like music? Do you like pressing buttons? Then I think you will like this.

Product:

I'm going to have a permanent link that I will click on to show the user how the beatkit works, and might even let them use it.
Will put up screenshots on the slides


Process:
Will show the other small things I did before I started on the beatKit
Will show the difficulty I had with getting the sounds to load

Conclusion:

Javascript is fun when you have an end goal in mind
Work on things that are related to your interests
Preserve and think on your problems.
```

## EDP:

I have completed all of the steps in the EDP, the eighth and final step being communicating the results, which I did via the in-class presentation and the expo.

## Skills:
The two skills I had to utilize in to use to do these presentations are
* Communication:
 I had to figure out a way to communicate my project and the creation of that project to people who don't know anything about it.
 * Organization:
 I had to organize my files because I couldn't get a link to my project preview to work, so I had to get the help of my brother to help me fix my file pathways. I also had to merge my repository and the main branch, also resolving merge conflicts.


## important takeaways from expo presentation:
after the in class presentation, we had to do an expo to present our projects to students outside of the sep program and three judges.

Things I think I did well:
* I was able to speak to the judges on the spot
* I was less stressed doing the expo than the in-class presentation.

Things I want to improve upon next year:
* I want to be able to give a stronger elevator pitch, with more info on my project, I feel that I didn't explain the process of my project enough.
* I want to be able to speak louder and more clearly, it was difficult to talk though because it was very loud in the expo.
