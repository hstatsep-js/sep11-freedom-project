## EDP {Engineering design process}
* I am still in the brainstorming part of the process


## Issues:
* Still need to figure out how to make divs able to stop the sound when clicked, and then when clicked afterwards, the sound will start up again
* these free mp3 files websites don't really have the best sounds
## progress on MVP!
* I have completed the mvp, I have the sounds needed, all of the Divs are clickable, and i have added CSS styling.
## What I Want to do:
* make divs change color when clicked (simple)
* find images for divs (simple)


## Tinkering:

## SKILLS:
* Debugging:
   I had to figure out how to fix the gliches and user errors that I was getting due to not writing syntax correctly, or having to restart my IDE because It wasn't working for some reason.
* How To Google:
    I had to look for sound sources, and it's actually quite difiiclut because most of them aren't free or are on suspcious websites.
