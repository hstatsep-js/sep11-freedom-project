## EDP {Engineering design process}
* I am still in the brainstorming part of the process

## Issues:
* live server extension and http-server isn't working, I cannot tinker further[]
## discoveries!
* in order to create multiple buttons that play sound when clicked, you have to create new **Keyword** names for each
* usage of arrays is needed to facilitate te usage of multiple sounds, as having individual buttons for my project is time consuming, and harder to manipulate

## Fp Goal for Mid-Winter Break:

set up the html/css for my freedom project, all of the fonts, colors, backgrounds, buttons/divs, so that when I come back, I am able to just work on the howler.js aspect of the website, to create my freedom project, which will be a interactive beat kit.
