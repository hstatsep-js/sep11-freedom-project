## EDP {Engineering design process}
* I am still in the brainstorming part of the process

## Issues:
* live server extension and http-server isn't working, I cannot tinker further[]
## discoveries!
* in order to create multiple buttons that play sound when clicked, you have to create new **Keyword** names for each
* usage of arrays is needed to facilitate te usage of multiple sounds, as having individual buttons for my project is time consuming, and harder to manipulate



## Tinkering:

## SKILLS:
* Organization:
    I created new folders that contained HTML, CSS, JS for different concepts I wanted to test
    I created folders that stored my sounds/noises
* How To Learn:
    I started to look more closely at the howler.js videos, writing out the code they wrote to see what it did, manipulating it, and making new things with it.


## Fp Goal for Mid-Winter Break:

set up the html/css for my freedom project, all of the fonts, colors, backgrounds, buttons/divs, so that when I come back, I am able to just work on the howler.js aspect of the website, to create my freedom project, which will be a interactive beat kit.


* brush up on front-end stylization(HTML/CSS)
