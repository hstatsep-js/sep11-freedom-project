* [adding Howler.js](https://youtu.be/sVtCUoZtKH8?si=whRrDfxE2YyTWDvO)
* I have created a howler-test.html file, although I am confused as to how to get specific sounds. I may need to download it to know.
* next week, i will set up a simple button, that makes noise when clicked.

I am building another button that makes another horse noise when clicked, it's saying it isn't defined right now though, don't know the issue

the buttons work, but they play the same sound, I don't know why.

* you have to rename sound, I thought it was always just sound for all Howler instances, but it isn't
* both buttons finnally work!
