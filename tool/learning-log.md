* [howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/)
* [adding Howler.js](https://youtu.be/sVtCUoZtKH8?si=whRrDfxE2YyTWDvO)
* I have created a howler-test.html file, although I am confused as to how to get specific sounds. I may need to download it to know.
* next week, i will set up a simple button, that makes noise when clicked.

I am building another button that makes another horse noise when clicked, it's saying it isn't defined right now though, don't know the issue

1/4/2024

the buttons work, but they play the same sound, I don't know why.

* you have to rename sound, I thought it was always just sound for all Howler instances, but it isn't
* both buttons finnally work!

*   I know how to confidentally create buttons that will play noise every time it's clicked
* in order to create muliple buttons, quickly, I have to create an array, and push my sounds into that array, which I have tinkered with in index.html

```js

// Create an array to store Howl sound instances
    var sounds = [];

     // Store the sound instance in the array
        sounds.push(sound);

```


* to stop a button, you have to create another button to end it, or make it so that is clicked once again, the sound will stop.
